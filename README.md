# MGSL - Maths General Scripting Language

---
## **Abstract**

A simple, almost laconic scripting language to perform mathematical operations.

It has almost unique syntax, visually similar to Haskell in places

MGSL is for people who refuse to learn R and who think they need something more than python for maths.

Also, who uses MATLAB?

---

## **Serious Abstract**

Don't use this. Just use Python, R, MATLAB or really any other interpreted scripting language for maths.

Lactonic is a fancy way of saying featureless.

Be warned that this is ***pure digital esotericism*** + a fun (brain melting) side project (idea that took literal months of my time) ðŸ™‚
