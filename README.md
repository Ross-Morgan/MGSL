# **MGSL - Maths General Scripting Language**

## **Abstract**

A simple, almost laconic scripting language to perform mathematical operations.

It has almost unique syntax, visually similar to Haskell in places

MGSL is for people who refuse to learn R and who think they need something more than python for maths.

Also, who uses MATLAB?

## **Serious Abstract**

Don't use this. Just use Python, R, MATLAB or really any other interpreted scripting language for maths.

Lactonic is a fancy way of saying featureless.

Be warned that this is ***pure digital esotericism*** + a fun (brain melting) side project (idea that took literal months of my time) ðŸ™‚

## **Installation**

1. Install a `c++` compiler (e.g. [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/))
2. Install the official [go](https://go.dev/dl/) compiler
3. Build and run the installer from `src/installer.go`
4. You have Installed MGSL.

## **Executing files**

Run the `mgsl` command

An experimental `mgslc` (or similar) command may be developed if extra performance could be benefitted from by large / computationally heavy scripts.

## **Background**

I am a secondary school student in the UK at the time of publishing (07/22) and I have never really had a large project to work on, only ever small ventures with 10 files at max. I have also always loved maths and wanted to create a programming language, so I decided to create this. It is by no means a useful utility. Python's stdlib has the statistics library, and numpy, pandas, etc can do literally everything else.

My largest reason for deciding to make a scripting language is leaning how languages such as python actually work and how they interpret strings as code. As of now I am fluent in Python only, but I can get by in JS, Rust and C/++. I decided to challenge myself by implementing a multiple lanuage design (GO and C++). I have ran into several issues with both languages but I am learning quickly.
